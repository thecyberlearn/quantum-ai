# Pre-Implementation Analysis Protocol

A comprehensive 3-phase approach to ensure thorough analysis before making any template changes.

## Overview

This protocol prevents the failures that occurred with the Social Ads Generator by ensuring complete understanding of requirements and existing implementations before any code changes are made.

## Phase 1: Complete Requirements Analysis

### 1.1 User Requirements Deep Dive

**Requirements Extraction Process:**
1. **Read the entire user request** multiple times
2. **Identify explicit requirements** (what they directly stated)
3. **Identify implicit requirements** (what they likely mean)
4. **Ask clarifying questions** if anything is unclear
5. **Document all requirements** in a structured format

**Requirements Documentation Template:**
```markdown
# Requirements Analysis: [Task Name]

## Explicit Requirements
- [ ] Requirement 1: [Description]
- [ ] Requirement 2: [Description]
- [ ] Requirement 3: [Description]

## Implicit Requirements
- [ ] Implied Requirement 1: [Description and reasoning]
- [ ] Implied Requirement 2: [Description and reasoning]

## Success Criteria
- [ ] Visual: [What should it look like?]
- [ ] Functional: [How should it behave?]
- [ ] Technical: [What technical standards must be met?]

## Constraints
- [ ] Technical constraints: [List]
- [ ] Design constraints: [List]
- [ ] Performance constraints: [List]

## Questions for Clarification
